# MSDR2025
Code submission


This repository contains the code, data, experiments and evaluation.

1. `data_clean/`
  - Jupyter notebook for **data generation**:
    - Takes expert trajectories.
    - Produces noisy variants of the expert data.
  - Proposed **cleaning pipeline**:
    - Denoises the noisy dataset using **DMP + LSTM**.

---

2. `IL_methods_comparison/`
This folder evaluates different IL methods on both noisy and cleaned datasets.

a. `input_dataset/`
- Datasets for training IL models.
- Contains both **noisy** and **cleaned** versions.

b. `Models/`
- Two Jupyter notebooks:
  - **IL training on noisy dataset**
  - **IL training on cleaned dataset**

c. `Plots/`
- Visualization of rollouts from different trained IL models.
- Compares performance on **noisy vs. cleaned** datasets.

d. `Rollout_trajectories/`
- Rollout trajectories generated by each IL method.
- Includes rollouts from **50 different initial positions**.

e. `Scoring/`
- Reference trajectory for evaluation.
- Scoring notebook:
  - Statistical comparison of IL methods.
  - Results on both noisy and cleaned datasets.
